Today I spent more time working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) *Responsive Web Design Certification* track, completing both the *Applied Visual Design* course and the *Applied Accessability* courses. I had planned to work on *Applied Visual Design* today and *Applied Accessability* tomorrow, but I completed *Applied Visual Design* much quicker than I anticipated.

Like the previous two courses, *Basic HTML and HTML5* and *CSS Basics*, *Applied Visual Design* was mostly a refresher course for me, but I did learn a few things, which is always exciting. *Applied Accessability*, however, was filled with new information for me which will change the way I look at web development going forward. I feel somewhat ashamed to admit that accessability concerns have never bee a high priority for me when writing code, but going forward I will be making sure to start working to make my code more accessible to people using tools like screen readers.
