This is the first of what I plan to be many blog posts on this new website of mine. I have created this website as a platform to share my thoughts, ideas, and to document my journey into (and hopefully through) the IT world. I had intended to write a much more in-depth post today, but I have spent the better part of the day trying to get a large series of small problems (mostly but not entirely resulting from user error) taken care of to get this blog launched. Since these words are now appearing on the internet, it would appear this task was a success.
