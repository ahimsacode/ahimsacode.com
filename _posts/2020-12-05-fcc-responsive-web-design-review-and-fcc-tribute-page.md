Last night and today I spent almost 6.75 hours watching Florin Pop's YouTube livestreams of him going through the same course materials and challenges I have gone through over the last few days. These included [Basic HTML and HTML5 - Live Stream #1](https://youtu.be/pACOweChpEU), [Basic CSS - Live Stream #2](https://youtu.be/8qmpMXqImds), [Applied Visual Design - Live Stream #3](https://youtu.be/YBCSKVczKak), [Accessibility and RWD Principles - Live Stream #4](https://youtu.be/WYokBX7rS8U), and the [Flexbox and CSS Grid - Live Stream #5](https://youtu.be/39EI97boIDo). Watching all of those videos was exhausting, and it felt like it took more mental energy than when I completed the challenges myself. Going forward, however, it should be easier as I only plan to watch one video at a time after completing each section covered.

After completing watching all of Florin Pop's Responsive Web Design course videos, I completed my first freeCodeCamp project, a [tribute page](https://ahimsaweb.cc/fcc/01-01-tribute-page/) put together in honor of freeCodeCamp. Either tonight or probably tomorrow, I plan to watch Florin Pop's video of him completing his tribute page challenge, and then I will move onto challenge #2!
