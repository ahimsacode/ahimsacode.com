All good stories must have a prelude.

When I was a child, my mom bought a second-hand i386 PC running MS-DOS from a relative to help her with her bookkeeping. I remember the computer came with a small box of 5.25 inch floppy disks with software, including the text adventure game [Star Trek: The Promethean Prophecy (1986)](#) and the adult graphic adventure game [Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards(1987)](#).
