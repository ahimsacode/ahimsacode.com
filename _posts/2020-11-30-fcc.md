Last night I began going through the certification course materials at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). My freeCodeCamp profile can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ahimsacode) for those that may be interested in that.

 It's been a few years since I've actively done any web development at all, so it's been a good refresher so far. I blew through the *Basic HTML and HTML5* course in no time, spending a few minutes on it last night before going to bed and finishing up today.

Tomorrow I should have some time to start the *Basic CSS* course and I plan to start putting together a simple website to track my progress learning to code all over again, which will include a page devoted to my progress on freeCodeCamp.
