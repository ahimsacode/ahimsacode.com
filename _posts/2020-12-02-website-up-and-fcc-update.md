title: "Website Up and freeCodeCamp Update"

As I mentioned in my last post, I setup a very basic [website](http://ahimsaweb.cc) to begin to build a portfolio of my development as a developer. I spent a lot of time setting up the server and reacquainting myself with *cPanel & WHM*, learning to use *Root WHM* instead of *Reseller WHM* for the first time, updating DNS settings, and doing some reading to remind myself about web server administration. I applied security patches and played around with SSH. After all of that, I uploaded a simple index.html file into the public_html directory on the server and another simple .index.html file into a subdirectory to begin tracking my progress as I go. This small website consisting of just two simple .html pages will grow with time. 

I also spent time yesterday and today finishing up the *CSS Basics* course for the freeCodeCamp *Responsive Web Design Certification* track. As with the *Basic HTML and HTML5* course I did a couple of days ago, I found the materials in this course to be an excellent refresher in something I have used for decades, but hadn't used in a few years. While I didn't necessarily learn anything new in either course, they both did a lot to help remind me what I'm doing and I feel like completing them was a worthwhile use of my time and energy.
