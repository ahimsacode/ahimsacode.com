After having taken a few days off from doing a lot, I'm about to embark on what is going to be quite the journey. Yesterday I recieved an email informing me that I had been approved for financial aid for the [Google IT Support Professional Certificate Program](https://grow.google/programs/it-support/). Last night I completed the materials for the first week, and today I completed the materials for the second week. My goal is to complete 1 week's worth of work every day until mid-January to complete the curriculum quickly in hopes of getting back into the job market as soon as possible. I have created [a microblog to document that journey](https://ahimsaweb.cc/it-support-pro-certificate-program.html) and [a page to track my progress](https://ahimsaweb.cc/it-support-pro-certificate-progress.html). 

Also, quite significantly, I have committed to begin the #100DaysOfCode challenge beginning tomorrow. I've created a simple [microblog to track that](https://ahimsaweb.cc/100DaysOfCode.html)as well, in addition to creating a [dedicated Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ahimsacode) for that purpose.
