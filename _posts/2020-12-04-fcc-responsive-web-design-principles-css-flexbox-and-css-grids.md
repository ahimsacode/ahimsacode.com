title: "freeCodeCamp Update: Completed Responsive Web Design Principles, CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid"

Today I spent more time on freeCodeCamp completing the short *Responsive Web Design Principles* course along with the *CSS Flexbox* and *CSS Grid* courses.

A few days ago I saw a reddit post where somebody commented with a link to [a blog post about an experienced developer that did the entire freeCodeCamp curriculum in 29 days](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/i-completed-the-entire-freecodecamp-curriculum-in-a-month-while-recording-everything/). The engineer's name is Florin Pop ([he can be found on Twitter](https://twitter.com/florinpop1705)) and in what he called "an amazing (and crazy ðŸ¤ª) journey," he spent 29 days recording 56 live streams for a total of 72 hours of content. Being someone who learns best through a combination of repetition, audiovisual media, and hands-on practice, I am planning to revisit the videos he made covering the materials I have already completed as a review before beginning my 5 responsive web design projects to earn my first certification. Going forward, I plan to watch each video after completing the corresponding certain sections.
