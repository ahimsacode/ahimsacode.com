Today I spent more time on freeCodeCamp completing the short *Responsive Web Design Principles* course along with the *CSS Flexbox* and *CSS Grid* courses.

A few days ago I saw a reddit post where somebody commented with a link to [a blog post about an experienced software engineer that did the entire freeCodeCamp curriculum in 29 days](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/i-completed-the-entire-freecodecamp-curriculum-in-a-month-while-recording-everything/).
