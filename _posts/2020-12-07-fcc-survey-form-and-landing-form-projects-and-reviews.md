Today I completed my second freeCodeCamp project -â€” the [*survey form*](#) --  before watching the recording of Florin Pop doing his [survey form livestream](https://youtu.be/8KF-IDkraNk). Finally, I finished my day by completing the [landing page project](#), and then, predictably, watching the recording of [Florin Pop's landing page livestream](https://youtu.be/fQ67kd4uEwc) (and then, of course, updating my [freeCodeCamp progress page](http://ahimsaweb.cc/fcc/index.html) and this blog short blog post).
